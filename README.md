npx jest  ( to start the test )


To make a new branch  ( make sure there are some kind of file change )
```md
git add .
git checkout -b my-new-branch
git commit -am 'initial workflow for testing'
git status
git push origin my-new-branch
```
If the new branch test passes then it can be merged.
Otherwise, the person reviewing the code can add a note on what needs to be fixed.
After fixing the code, do this and resubmit:

```md
git commit -am 'fixing broken code'
git push origin my-new-branch
```

To delete a branch
```md
git checkout main   ( first switch to a different branch )
git branch -d my-second-branch   ( delete )
git branch -D my-second-branch   ( force delete - if delete doesn't work )
```

If trying to use the same branch name as one that has been deleted on github
we can try these first, and if it's not updating we can reload vs code by going
the the command palette and selecting "Reload Window."

To delete a branch
```md
git checkout main   ( switch to a different branch to delete current branch )
git fetch --prune
git branch -d my-second-branch   ( delete )
git branch -D my-second-branch   ( force delete - if delete doesn't work )
```
